# I’m @sfraleyreese-owasp
> I am an OWASP/CIS member, researcher, and part-time teacher aimed at improving DevSecOps workflows and efficiency... while also managing these areas for a fortune 100 company. 
- My specialization is in containerized technology security and serverless cloud security for enterprises, with innovations in image life-cycle managment, enterprise secured CICD design and shift-left feedback cycle optimization.
- I have 23 years active experience in software architecture and development and recently moved to a security-focused role 3 years ago. You have most likely used some of my work.
- I am an expert in Docker, K8S (and variants), NodeJs, TypeScript, Terraform, dotNet (C#/F#), Java, AWS, Azure, SQL Server, Oracle, Mongo, and highly profficient in many many other areas
- For security tooling I am an expert in Prisma Compute (formerly Twistlock), Prisma Cloud (formerly Redlock), Qualys, Checkmarx, and of course our CIS benchmarks and OWASP flagship projects
